Like "Hello Dolly" from Matt, "He's Dead, Him" produces random lines from Star Trek: The Original Series.

== Description ==

Do you like the idea behind Matt's "Hello, Dolly" plugin, but feel that it doesn't feed your inner nerd? Then here's "He's Dead, Jim" which has been shamelessly ported from Matt's plugin. The concept is the same, except that instead of lines from "Hello, Dolly" you get lines from Star Trek: The Original Series. There are no settings, just install it, activate it, and enjoy.

For more information, visit the [plugin's homepage](http://www.kjodle.net/wordpress/hes-dead-jim/). 

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `hes-dead-jim` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What happens if "Hello Dolly" is still activated? =

Normally, "He's Dead, Jim" will output its text where "Hello Dolly" does. If "Hello Dolly" is activated, "He's Dead Jim" will output its text *to the left* of "Hello Dolly"'s output.

= What happens if "Make It So" is also activated? = 

"He's Dead, Jim" will appear in a box to the left of the screen, and "Make It So" will appear in a box to the right of that.

== Changelog ==

= 1.0 =
* Initial release.

= 1.1 =
* Added the css to a separate stylesheet, saving on server resources and enabling default styles to be more easily overridden in a child theme.

== Upgrade Notice ==

= 1.1 =
Version 1.1 looks better with the current WordPress styling, as it also makes use of the "Open Sans" font. It also caches the default styles, saving server resources.
